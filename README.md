# My React Perf Workshop

In front-end web development there are 2 *key* performance indicators, amongst others:
1. **Fast and smooth:** are animations and updates fast enough while the user interacts? Render perf.
1. **Time to interact:** how long does it take until your website loads and is interactive? Load perf.

React is a framework that provides tools and functionalities for optimizing both. This workshop has one part for each topic:
1. [Rendering](/src/rendering/RENDERING.md)
1. [Loading](/src/loading/LOADING.MD)

Both topics are unrelated and independent so they can be done in any order.

This is not a workshop for beginners but also not exclusive to experts either. Hopefully, after this workshop, you'll be introduced to some intermediate knowledge.

Ready to start? Let's go!

## General

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn profile`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder with profiling capabilities and serves it on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).<br />
Your app is ready to be profiled with [React Dev Tools](https://reactjs.org/docs/optimizing-performance.html#profiling-components-with-the-devtools-profiler)!
